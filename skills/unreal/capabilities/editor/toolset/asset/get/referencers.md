## Native identities

Tool:

```text
editor_toolset.toolsets.asset.AssetTools.get_referencers
```

Toolset:

```text
editor_toolset.toolsets.asset.AssetTools
```

## What this tool does

Lists assets that reference the specified asset.

## When to use it

Use this skill when the requested outcome matches its purpose.
Choose it only when it is the most specific available action.
Do not substitute it for a narrower read or mutation capability.

## Technical execution posture

Use the returned structured evidence directly, but still confirm the live
schema because names do not prove side effects.

## Human-authored guidance

Edit only between matching manual-field markers.
Regeneration preserves those contents and refreshes everything else.
A revision mismatch marks preserved guidance for human review.

### SHAR-specific use cases

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-use-cases -->
Use this tool to inspect incoming Asset Registry relationships before SHAR
replaces, moves, or removes a generated asset. The verified `MF_Rotate2D`
fixture had 14 referencers across BaseMaterial and Interchange plugin content.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-use-cases -->

### Project prerequisites

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-prerequisites -->
- The canonical SHAR project and Asset Registry must be ready.
- Supply one exact existing virtual asset path.
- Review the complete returned target set before any dependent mutation.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-prerequisites -->

### Validated argument example

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: validated-arguments -->
```json
{
  "asset_path": "/BaseMaterial/Materials/Functions/MF_Rotate2D"
}
```
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: validated-arguments -->

### Project verification notes

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-verification -->
Two calls returned the same 14 referencer paths. For every returned asset, an
independent `get_dependencies` call included the original `MF_Rotate2D` target,
confirming the incoming relationship in both directions.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-verification -->

### Known project caveats

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: known-caveats -->
- Referencers can belong to other enabled plugin roots, not only `/Game`.
- The result describes Asset Registry relationships, not current runtime use.
- Counts can change after plugin enablement, registry refresh, import, or asset
  edits; capture the set immediately before a mutation decision.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: known-caveats -->

### Manual guidance reviewed revision

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: manual-review-revision -->
[REVIEW_REQUIRED]
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: manual-review-revision -->

- Current revision: `1.0.0/c6e4275ffd125b32daf25b03c2746196b76c1fdd123994bde79239a30149342b`
- Manual guidance status: **Review required**

## Before invocation

1. Run `shar-unreal-mcp doctor` and require `ready: true`.
1. Select this skill from the central index, not from memory.
1. Refresh the live schema:

```text
shar-unreal-mcp describe editor_toolset.toolsets.asset.AssetTools
```

1. Confirm every required input against the current schema.

## Inputs

### `asset_path`

- Required: **yes**
- Type: `string`
- Purpose:

Content path to the asset.

## Invocation example

Replace placeholders with validated project values.

```text
shar-unreal-mcp call \
  editor_toolset.toolsets.asset.AssetTools \
  editor_toolset.toolsets.asset.AssetTools.get_referencers \
  --arguments '
{
  "asset_path": "<value>"
}
'
```

## Expected output

A list of content paths for assets that reference the given asset.

### `returnValue`

- Required: **yes**
- Type: `array<string>`
- Purpose:

`returnValue` has no prose; confirm its meaning with `describe`.

## Verification

- Check the returned `isError` state and structured output.
- Compare returned identities and counts with the requested scope.
- Treat transport success as insufficient evidence by itself.
- Confirm the response belongs to the open editor project.
- Reject evidence derived from stale discovery state.

## Common failure modes

- The skill may be stale; run `describe` and regenerate the catalog.
- A required editor object or asset may not be loaded.
- Placeholder values are not valid project identities.
- Native validation may reject semantically invalid JSON values.
