Toolset:

## What this tool does

Get the root level sequence currently open in the Sequencer editor.

## When to use it

Use this skill when the requested outcome matches its purpose.
Choose it only when it is the most specific available action.
Do not substitute it for a narrower read or mutation capability.

## Technical execution posture

Use the returned structured evidence directly, but still confirm the live
schema because names do not prove side effects.

## Human-authored guidance

Edit only between matching manual-field markers.
Regeneration preserves those contents and refreshes everything else.
A revision mismatch marks preserved guidance for human review.

### SHAR-specific use cases

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-use-cases -->
Use this tool to identify the root LevelSequence currently open in the Sequencer
editor before SHAR issues editor-global reads.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-use-cases -->

### Project prerequisites

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-prerequisites -->
- Require an open Sequencer editor.
- Treat the returned ref as editor-session state rather than a requested asset
  argument.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-prerequisites -->

### Validated argument example

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: validated-arguments -->
```json
{}
```
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: validated-arguments -->

### Project verification notes

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-verification -->
Two disposable cycles returned the exact open sequence ref. After
`close_sequence`, the tool returned the string `None` rather than JSON null.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-verification -->

### Known project caveats

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: known-caveats -->
- This tool takes no sequence argument.
- Closed Sequencer state serializes as the string `None`.
- Current and focused sequences can differ when editing a subsequence.
- Re-query after focus or editor changes.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: known-caveats -->

- Manual guidance status: **Current**

## Before invocation

1. Run `shar-unreal-mcp doctor` and require `ready: true`.
1. Select this skill from the central index, not from memory.
1. Refresh the live schema:

```text
shar-unreal-mcp describe animation_toolset.toolsets.sequencer.SequencerTools
```

1. Confirm every required input against the current schema.

## Inputs

This tool accepts no input fields.

## Invocation example

Replace placeholders with validated project values.

```text
shar-unreal-mcp call \
  animation_toolset.toolsets.sequencer.SequencerTools \
  animation_toolset.toolsets.sequencer.SequencerTools.get_current_sequence \
  --arguments '
{}
'
```

## Expected output

The root LevelSequence asset, or None if no sequence is open.

### `returnValue`

- Required: **yes**
- Type: `object`
- Purpose:

Represents a reference to a UObject or UClass.

## Verification

- Check the returned `isError` state and structured output.
- Compare returned identities and counts with the requested scope.
- Treat transport success as insufficient evidence by itself.
- Confirm the response belongs to the open editor project.
- Reject evidence derived from stale discovery state.

## Common failure modes

- The skill may be stale; run `describe` and regenerate the catalog.
- A required editor object or asset may not be loaded.
- Placeholder values are not valid project identities.
- Native validation may reject semantically invalid JSON values.
