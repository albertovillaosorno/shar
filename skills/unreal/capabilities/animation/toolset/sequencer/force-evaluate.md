## Native identities

Tool:

```text
animation_toolset.toolsets.sequencer.SequencerTools.force_evaluate
```

Toolset:

```text
animation_toolset.toolsets.sequencer.SequencerTools
```

## What this tool does

Force the Sequencer to evaluate and update the viewport.

## When to use it

Use this skill when the requested outcome matches its purpose.
Choose it only when it is the most specific available action.
Do not substitute it for a narrower read or mutation capability.

## Technical execution posture

The native identity does not establish side effects. Review the live schema and
editor context before invocation.

## Human-authored guidance

Edit only between matching manual-field markers.
Regeneration preserves those contents and refreshes everything else.
A revision mismatch marks preserved guidance for human review.

### SHAR-specific use cases

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-use-cases -->
Use this tool to force an immediate SHAR sequence evaluation after key,
section, or binding changes.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-use-cases -->

### Project prerequisites

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-prerequisites -->
- Require `shar-unreal-mcp doctor` to report `ready: true` and refresh the
  live SequencerTools schema.
- Open the exact disposable or recoverable Level Sequence and derive every
  binding, track, section, and folder reference from live returns.
- Capture the matching getter before mutation and define whole-folder cleanup.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-prerequisites -->

### Validated argument example

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: validated-arguments -->
```json
{}
```
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: validated-arguments -->

### Project verification notes

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-verification -->
The call returned true and `get_current_sequence` still reported the exact
disposable Level Sequence.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-verification -->

### Known project caveats

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: known-caveats -->
- Sequence, track, section, binding, and folder references become stale after
  structural edits, closing Sequencer, or deleting the asset.
- A true Boolean return is not sufficient; verify the exact reader state and
  restore transient editor settings when applicable.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: known-caveats -->

- Manual guidance status: **Current**

## Before invocation

1. Run `shar-unreal-mcp doctor` and require `ready: true`.
1. Select this skill from the central index, not from memory.
1. Refresh the live schema:

```text
shar-unreal-mcp describe animation_toolset.toolsets.sequencer.SequencerTools
```

1. Confirm every required input against the current schema.
1. Capture pre-state and define an independent postcondition check.

## Inputs

This tool accepts no input fields.

## Invocation example

Replace placeholders with validated project values.

```text
shar-unreal-mcp call \
  animation_toolset.toolsets.sequencer.SequencerTools \
  animation_toolset.toolsets.sequencer.SequencerTools.force_evaluate \
  --arguments '
{}
'
```

## Expected output

### `returnValue`

- Required: **yes**
- Type: `boolean`
- Purpose:

`returnValue` has no prose; confirm its meaning with `describe`.

## Verification

- Check the returned `isError` state and structured output.
- Compare returned identities and counts with the requested scope.
- Treat transport success as insufficient evidence by itself.
- Verify changed state through a separate read or inspection.
- Use another capability to confirm the postcondition.
- Inspect editor logs when state is not directly observable.

## Common failure modes

- The skill may be stale; run `describe` and regenerate the catalog.
- A required editor object or asset may not be loaded.
- Placeholder values are not valid project identities.
- Native validation may reject semantically invalid JSON values.
