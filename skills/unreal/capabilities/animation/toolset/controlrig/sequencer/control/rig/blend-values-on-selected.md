## What this tool does

Perform a blend operation on selected keys or controls.

## When to use it

Use this skill when the requested outcome matches its purpose.
Choose it only when it is the most specific available action.
Do not substitute it for a narrower read or mutation capability.

## Technical execution posture

The native identity does not establish side effects. Review the live schema and
editor context before invocation.

## Human-authored guidance

Edit only between matching manual-field markers.
Regeneration preserves those contents and refreshes everything else.
A revision mismatch marks preserved guidance for human review.

### SHAR-specific use cases

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-use-cases -->
Use this tool to blend the currently selected SHAR Control Rig value toward a
neighboring key at the active playhead.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-use-cases -->

### Project prerequisites

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-prerequisites -->
- Require `shar-unreal-mcp doctor` to report `ready: true` and refresh the
  live SequencerControlRigTools schema.
- Open the exact disposable Level Sequence, discover the Control Rig track and
  section from live returns, and validate every control name and type with
  `get_controls_info`.
- Capture the matching value, mask, selection, key, layer, or space reader
  before mutation and define whole-folder deletion.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-prerequisites -->

### Validated argument example

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: validated-arguments -->
```json
{
  "blend_value": 1.0,
  "operation": "tween",
  "sequence": {
    "refPath": "/Game/SHAR_MCP_Validation_ControlRig_Large_260718/LS_MCP_Large_260718.LS_MCP_Large_260718"
  }
}
```
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: validated-arguments -->

### Project verification notes

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: project-verification -->
With only `FloatControl` selected at frame 100, the evaluated value changed
from 5 to 10. The native return was false despite the observable mutation.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: project-verification -->

### Known project caveats

<!-- BEGIN MANUAL FIELD: known-caveats -->
- Sequence, Control Rig track, section, binding, and control identities are
  live editor references and become stale after structural edits, closing
  Sequencer, or deleting the asset.
- Validate every control name and type through `get_controls_info`; a Boolean
  return or numeric value alone does not prove type compatibility.
- The tested call returned false while the selected value changed from 5 to
  10. Treat the Boolean as unreliable and always re-read the selected value.
- The operation string is a runtime token; this validation covered only
  `tween`.
<!-- END MANUAL FIELD: known-caveats -->

- Manual guidance status: **Current**

## Before invocation

1. Run `shar-unreal-mcp doctor` and require `ready: true`.
1. Select this skill from the central index, not from memory.
1. Refresh the live schema:

```text
shar-unreal-mcp describe animation_toolset.toolsets.controlrig_sequencer.SequencerControlRigTools
```

1. Confirm every required input against the current schema.
1. Capture pre-state and define an independent postcondition check.

## Inputs

### `blend_value`

- Required: **yes**
- Type: `number`
- Purpose:

Blend value, typically -1.0 to 1.0.

### `operation`

- Required: **yes**
- Type: `string`
- Purpose:

The blend operation. One of: 'tween', 'blend_to_neighbor', 'push_pull',
'blend_relative', 'blend_to_ease', 'smooth_rough'.

### `sequence`

- Required: **yes**
- Type: `object`
- Purpose:

Represents a reference to a UObject or UClass.

## Invocation example

Replace placeholders with validated project values.

```text
shar-unreal-mcp call \
  animation_toolset.toolsets.controlrig_sequencer.SequencerControlRigTools \
  animation_toolset.toolsets.controlrig_sequencer.SequencerControlRigTools.blend_values_on_selected \
  --arguments '
{
  "blend_value": 0.0,
  "operation": "<value>",
  "sequence": {}
}
'
```

## Expected output

True if the blend succeeded.

### `returnValue`

- Required: **yes**
- Type: `boolean`
- Purpose:

`returnValue` has no prose; confirm its meaning with `describe`.

## Verification

- Check the returned `isError` state and structured output.
- Compare returned identities and counts with the requested scope.
- Treat transport success as insufficient evidence by itself.
- Verify changed state through a separate read or inspection.
- Use another capability to confirm the postcondition.
- Inspect editor logs when state is not directly observable.

## Common failure modes

- The skill may be stale; run `describe` and regenerate the catalog.
- A required editor object or asset may not be loaded.
- Placeholder values are not valid project identities.
- Native validation may reject semantically invalid JSON values.
